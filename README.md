This app uses the Domainsdb.info API to check if certain domain names are available. The API allows you to search the domain name database by name or similar name. It would be an easier way for someone to easily check if their domain name is taken before they begin the process. 


The project will have a basic layout and api function. There will be three pages: Home page with information on how to use the app and what queries are allowed,a New Search page with a search bar and ‘save this search’ button, and a Saved Searches page that uses local storage to list the saved items. 


The landing page/Homepage will have a search bar to create a new search, information about the App, and each page will render a nav bar for navigation.
The user will be able to navigate to the Home page, Saved Searches page, and New Search pages.
On the Home page, the user will be able to create a new search and view information about how the app works.
Once the user submits their search term they will be directed to the New Search page, where the list of information is shown for that search and the user can add the new search to the Saved Searches list.
On the Saved Searches page,the user can view a list of all saved searches with the search term and relevent information.
